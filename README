Random Beat Generator

This is a code that generates random beats for users. I think about this code when working on side shuffle exercise with my physical theripy.
The code is written in Python and can be run on any machine that has Python installed.

How to use the code:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.

Install the required libraries by running the following command:

pip install pyaudio

Run the code by running the following command:

python random_beats.py

The code will prompt you to enter minimum and maximum duration of the time interval between each beat. Enter a valid integer value when when the questions ask and press Enter.
The code would then generate beats wiith randomize interval duration between the min and max interval time you entered.

You can listen to the generated beats until you stop the code by pressing CTRL + C.

Note: This code is meant to be used for exercise when you need unpredictiable beats to help you practice your response time. Feel free to make improvements on the code! :)
